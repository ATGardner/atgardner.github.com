<p>I am writing this post for several reasons. First, I’d like to put my thoughts into words, just to arrange all the conflicting information I have discovered. Secondly, these findings might be of help to other developers struggling to figure out what the Cordova-cli is doing in the projects. Thirdly, I’d be happy to read any comments and insights on where I got it wrong, where I missed something important, and why my expectations of the tool might be not-realistic.</p> <p>So, to start things off, I’ll describe the state my project was in, before I dived head first into Cordova. I am currently working on a cross-platform mobile application, written mostly in JavaScript and HTML. We use Cordova as a means to wrap it into Apple’s App Store, but we’ve only been working on the iOS version until now.</p> <p>This was the state of the project, while using an older Cordova-cli version (@4.3):</p> <ul> <li><strong>config.xml</strong> – empty of any plugins  <li><strong>cordova/plugins</strong> – conains all of our plugins  <li><strong>cordova/platforms/ios/&lt;project&gt;/plugins</strong> – contains the plugins’ native files  <li><strong>cordova/platforms/ios/&lt;project&gt;/platform_www</strong> – contains only <em>cordova.js</em>  <li><strong>cordova/platforms/ios/&lt;project&gt;/www</strong> – not checked into git, created by running <em>cordova prepare</em></li></ul> <p>Whenever I’d run “cordova prepare”, it will just copy the <strong>cordova/www</strong> folder into the <strong>cordova/platforms/ios/&lt;project&gt;/www</strong> folder. There were no changes being made to any <strong>config.xml</strong> or and <strong>json</strong> file. It took me while to figure it out, but I think it happened because Cordova was not managing any plugins for us (the <strong>config.xml</strong> is empty, even though the <strong>cordova/plugins</strong> did contain plugin folders). It was probably made on purpose by whoever first built the project, as I later learned that trying to work along with cordova-cli constantly meddling with your project is impossible.</p> <p>Since the cordova-cli wasn’t interfering with our files, whenever we found a bug in any cordova plugin, or just wanted to add or alter something, we’d change the native code directly in the <strong>cordova/platforms/ios/&lt;project&gt;/plugins</strong> (working directly inside Xcode). This was (and still is) the easiest way to debug and check our changes. And since it was all already in our git repository, that was all we needed.</p>
