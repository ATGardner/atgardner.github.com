My name is Noam Gal, and I plan on hiking the [Pacific Crest Trail] in 2014,
after about 12 years of fantasizing about it. (Just writing this sentence gave
me the chills).

I live with my partner and cat in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, Israel, and work as a software
engineer, currently developing a mobile application for my company.

I really enjoy hiking, though being a lazy git, I rarely actually go out and do
it. What I dislike the most are the logistics of getting to the hike's location,
worrying about water and food, and preparing for the hike with maps. The actual
walking for hours is the fun bit. I guess the PCT is not the easiest trail,
logistics wise, but I am sure the benefits of walking all those miles, and the
amazing views I will encounter, will outweigh the "trouble" of preparing for the
hike.

I have hiked the [Appalachian Trail] back in 2002, the [GR20] (200 Km) in 2011
and the [TMB] (180 Km) in 2013. I also did almost half of the [Israel National
Trail] in 2008, and two weeks on the [Camino de Santiago] in 2008 as well.
