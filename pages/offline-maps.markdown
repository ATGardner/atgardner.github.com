Here is a short walk-through explaining how to use the offline map files with [Backcountry Navigator](#backcountry-navigator) or [Orux Maps](#orux-maps). The gpx/kml file in step 1 refers to the file I used to generate the map file from, usually downloaded from the specific trail's web site. The sqlitedb/mbtiles file refers to the file extracted from the zip downloaded from my blog.
