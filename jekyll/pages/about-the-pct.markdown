The [Pacific Crest Trail] (PCT) is a 2,650 miles long hiking trail (About 4,240 Km) along the mountains on the west coast of the United States. It goes along from the Mexican border in the south, all the way up north to the Canadian border, and it takes an average of 5 months to complete it from end to end.
    
I will be starting my thru-hike on the Mexican border in the south in mid April 2014, aiming to finish it by mid-late September in Canada.
