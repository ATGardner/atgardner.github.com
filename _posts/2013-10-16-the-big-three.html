<div>It wasn't easy deciding which backpack/sleeping bag/shelter I'd like to carry on my hike. I made many comparisons between different manufacturers
  and tried to pick out the best gear I can afford.<br/><br/>Backpack: <br/>I have a <a
      href="http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/mariposa-ultralight-backpack-all.html" target="_blank">Gossamer Gear Mariposa Plus</a> backpack,
  from around 2008. Mine looks a bit different than the current model, both in shape (The closure system) and in materials (Mine is made out of
  SilNylon, and not this tougher dyneema fabric). I initially bought it before heading out to hike the Israel National Trail, and I highly recommend
  it.<br/><br/>It can really handle above average loads, for an aspiring (but-not-quite-there-yet) ultra-light hiker such as me. On my INT hike I
  think I had a rather light total pack weight, cutting down to carry only essentials, and carrying a <a href="http://tarptent.com/rainbow.html"
                                                                                                         target="_blank">Rainbow</a> Tarptent. But
  since then, I went out to several shorter hikes in the desert, where I had to carry up to 8 Liters of water on my back. Picking up the backpack when
  it was fully loaded was no fun, but it held.<br/>

  <br/>I figured that after 5 years, it's time for me to find a new backpack, and I was contemplating just ordering the newer Mariposa model, or maybe
  a Gorilla, but during my recent hike on the Tour du Mont Blanc, with my old backpack, I noticed that I sweat a lot along my back, even when the
  weather itself was not exceptionally hot. I recalled reading about the <a href="http://zpacks.com/backpacks/arc_blast.shtml" target="_blank">ZPacks
    Arc Blast</a>, with its outer frame that enables ventilation along the back, and figured I should look into it.<br/><br/>Back in Israel I found a
  hiker who owned an Arc Blast, and I drove over to have a look at it. I was very impressed. It seemed strong and roomy. I was almost hooked on the
  idea of ordering it. I just needed to finally do it, to mark the beginning of my PCT gear purchasing season.<br/><br/>Sleeping Bag: <br/>Now, the
  sleeping bag is another story - Back on the AT I used some unheard-of sleeping bag brand I bought in Israel, and it worked, I guess. There was
  nothing ultra-light about it, but it was a decent 20 degrees synthetic bag (-7c), and I managed to carry it (almost) all the way to Katahdin (At
  some point I used a fleece blanket instead, and just shipped the bag ahead towards the White Mountains, but that's a different story).<br/><br/>Ever
  since, I kept on using it for short weekend trips in Israel, also carrying it on my two week walk along the Camino de Santiago, for no real reason
  (You can easily get by there with a thin sleeping bag liner instead). But I knew I'd have to find something more serious for my next big
  hike.<br/><br/>The opportunity came in 2011, when I was planning my hike on the GR20, in Corsica. I knew the time has came for me to buy a new
  sleeping bag, that would be especially light for the upcoming hard trail. Just then <a href="http://www.golite.com/" target="_blank">GoLite</a> had
  one of their sales, and I managed to buy their Ultra-Light 3 Seasons Quilt at almost half price, for $160 dollars. Back then it was rated as a 20
  degrees bag, though now they sell a similar quilt and rate it for 30. Anyway, it was a great price for a good and light bag that many people have
  used on hikes along the PCT and CDT. It was a pain getting it here, though - I had to use relatives in Florida to actually make the order, have them
  send it over to other relatives in NYC, whose parents visited them, and carried the bag to back to Israel for me. A royal pain in the ass. The pain
  in the ass being me, mostly.<br/><br/>The quilt served me well in Corsica. But sadly, one year later I lent it to someone who came in for advice on
  the GR20. I lent him a lot of gear - my backpack, tarptent, trekking poles and mattress as well. But he managed to get just my quilt stolen. He was
  in quite a fix there, in a rain storm on the mountains of Corsica, finding out he has no quilt in his backpack. But he managed to finish his hike. I
  got stuck without a decent sleeping bag again.<br/><br/>So now I was on the lookout for a new sleeping bag/quilt. Golite didn't have their sales
  when I was looking around lately, and I was trying to decide mainly between them, <a href="http://katabaticgear.com/" target="_blank">Katabatic
    Gear</a>, <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/" target="_blank">enLIGHTened Equipment</a> and <a href="http://zpacks.com/"
                                                                                                              target="_blank">ZPacks</a>. Trying to
  compare price, weight and degrees rating is hard. Especially when the most expensive bags are the best, naturally. I was mostly looking out for
  hydrophobic down, which is a rather new thing from the past two years or so, which protect the down from losing all its loft when wet, and
  effectively reduces the main reason to prefer synthetic bags over it.<br/><br/>So that eliminated GoLite (They just now released a hooded jacket
  with a water repellent down, so I bet next season more of their product will use it).<br/>

  I've heard many good things on Katabatic Gear, and also enLIGHTened Equipment are well known for their high quality quilts, and much more reasonably
  prices quilts, but at the end I decided I will go and add the <a href="http://zpacks.com/quilts/sleepingbag.shtml" target="_blank">ZPacks 20 Degree
    850 Fill Power Down Sleeping Bag</a> to the already-decided-upon Arc Blast, and just went ahead and ordered them together straight from the site.
  Shipping to Israel was also a factor, and I think ZPacks had the cheapest shipping cost for me.<br/><br/>Shelter: <br/>I was thinking about
  replacing my old Rainbow (which weighs around 1Kg) with a shelter that weighs almost half of it. I used the excellent <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As-hvbUBJ_X_dGgwNkwwZUp6bGhyVzBrcmNhUjR3Z0E&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0" target="_blank">SUL/XUL
    Solo Fully Enclosed Shelter Comparisons</a>&nbsp;table maintened by <a
      href="http://hikelighter.com/2011/12/29/sulxul-enclosed-shelter-comparisons/">HikeLighter.com</a>, and tried to figure out for myself how much
  less comfortable I'm willing to be (I've never slept under a tarp) in order to shave off some grams. My mind was almost set on some kind of <a
      href="http://zpacks.com/shelter/hexamid.shtml">Hexamid Solo</a> combination with a beak, or maybe even the <a
      href="http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/tents/ssX.html">Skyscape X</a>, but at the end I couldn't justify such a crazy expense, and I decided to
  stick with my current tent for now.<br/><br/></div>
