 Wow. The third hard day in a row. Today we've hiked almost as much as yesterday, with almost as much climbing, and
 much more down hill. It was tiring.
 In the beginning of the day we had a climb up to Fire Creek Pass, and then
 started hiking down, stopping for a nice break at Mica Lake. The trail went further down, all the way to Milk Creek
 before starting a brutal climb of 2500 feet.
 We had another break up on the chilly ridge. I double checked the
 food I have left, and discovered I have an extra Clif Bar, and two extra oatmeal packets. One packet was eaten on
 the spot.
 The trail down started horribly, with a narrow path, which was a bit lower than the surrounding
 shrubs. My shoes kept bumping into each other, and the trail itself wasn't flat, which made for even harder walking.
 I was cursing the switchbacks down with every step, until we finally got back into the woods, and the two got
 better.
 It didn't get much better with all the fallen trees we had to hike over or around. But we made it.

 We had another short stop just by Vista Creek, after the down hill was mostly over, and then continued on some easy
 trail towards the Suiattle River. Once there, we crossed the bridge, and had a look at the campsite in the middle of
 two noisy streams. Seems like it'll be hard to camp there. We were aiming at a spot about 1.5 miles further.

 While hiking on, and again climbing up, I was trying to recall if that spot was a campsite, or just a water source
 on Halfmile's app. It was just a water source - a stream of water flowing down the ridge. We filled up and went
 ahead to try and find a campsite for the night.
 Luckily, after less than 0.5 miles we found a reasonable spot,
 and set camp. Lighthouse have me an extra dinner he had, so I had my usual Knorr meal, and a dinner of Mac 
 Cheese as well. I gave him two extra tortillas I suddenly discovered I had.
 We saw a southbounder just before
 dark. He was flip flopping, not sure from where, and was heading down to the Suiattle River for the night.
