What a day!
We planned to do about 22 miles today, which isn't that much. But today it contained about 5,500
 feet climb AND 5,500 feet descent. I am not sure, but I think this makes it the hardest day so far, as far as
 vertical gain and loss go.

 During the first half of the day we mostly climbed towards Benson Pass. Even though it didn't have any snow, it was
 quite a climb. I knew I was in for as long day, so I was listening to my audio book during most of the climb, just
 to make the time pass a bit faster.

 From the top, we still had another 2000 feet climb to look forward to. After getting down to near Benson Lake, the
 climb up to Seavey Pass began, for our amusement. We were not amused.

 We kept on crawling slowly up, until we finished that one too. The annoying bit of going down from the pass was all
 the little spots of more climbing up while generally hiking down and along the canyon. Like twisting the dagger at
 our backs. But we made it.

 We are currently hiding inside or tents from the mosquitoes, after finishing dinner. I think Yair should be in LA by
 now. I hope he gets a good night's rest before his flight tomorrow.
