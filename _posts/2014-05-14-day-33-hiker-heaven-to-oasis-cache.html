<div>I managed to postpone our exit from Hiker Heaven until around 9.<br />At one point a group of hikers was digging a 6" deep trench for a pipe for the gray shower water to go to other side     of the yard, instead of into the troublesome septic tank. I lent a hand.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kd9i9YWRtsM/VVxk4OLE9hI/AAAAAAAFd1Q/Y7D_W6UzC6I/s1600/2014-05-14%2B12.19.37.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kd9i9YWRtsM/VVxk4OLE9hI/AAAAAAAFd1Q/Y7D_W6UzC6I/s640/2014-05-14%2B12.19.37.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">A view back on the trail. Nice switchbacks.</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>Yesterday a reporter from Backpacker magazine interviewed Donna Saufley for their next issue. And since then a     photographer was hanging around, shooting hikers doing hikers' stuff at the Heaven. He had a blast with all the <u>hikers</u>    digging and moving dirt, you will definitely see some photos from that bit. I think he made every effort to avoid     getting a photo of me, so I won't be on next month's cover. Or anywhere.<br />Well, we finally left the Heaven, and I got a good hug from Donna. I was surprised she remembered my trail name, and     she wished me to enjoy my hike. It was very nice.<br />We got a ride to the trail head, saving us some annoying in town road walk, and headed out. The weather was hot, but     it was a bit windy which kept things all right for me.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r6kgKpdm3ME/VVxk4Dvv7_I/AAAAAAAFd1Y/8j1dobYrMyU/s1600/2014-05-14%2B12.59.16.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r6kgKpdm3ME/VVxk4Dvv7_I/AAAAAAAFd1Y/8j1dobYrMyU/s640/2014-05-14%2B12.59.16.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Siesta and Bomber having a nap.</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>At first we climbed up a small ridge, and saw Agua Dulce from the top. We finally reached a nice shady tree at the     end of the climb, and met Cheese, Bomber and Siesta resting there. We joined in, and had a short nap, before heading     over to the next spot.<br />That next spot was the first cache of the day. Another nice shady spot, the same cast of characters, and a shorter     nap this time. From there, it was mostly a climb.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3tI4qYGLIhI/VVxk4O101nI/AAAAAAAFd1U/X4Smkv4CjGs/s1600/2014-05-14%2B14.16.45.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3tI4qYGLIhI/VVxk4O101nI/AAAAAAAFd1U/X4Smkv4CjGs/s640/2014-05-14%2B14.16.45.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Nice view on Bouquet Reservoir. Sadly, we didn't end up there.</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>After finishing that final climb of the day, I put on some music to run the final, short, bit down to the cache. I     reached it to find Baby Wipes resting a bit before heading out to Casa de Luna, and Gabriel and French Toast, who     just reached there before me.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4bKZQ3uiK-Y/VVxk5hZnLaI/AAAAAAAFd1k/JUakiS0f3rw/s1600/2014-05-14%2B18.42.41.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4bKZQ3uiK-Y/VVxk5hZnLaI/AAAAAAAFd1k/JUakiS0f3rw/s640/2014-05-14%2B18.42.41.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Baby-Wipes and Cheese at the Oasis Cache</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tMHzQkkEhsw/VVxk53d1YAI/AAAAAAAFd1o/LNnqefmotzc/s1600/2014-05-14%2B18.42.48.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tMHzQkkEhsw/VVxk53d1YAI/AAAAAAAFd1o/LNnqefmotzc/s640/2014-05-14%2B18.42.48.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Alpine-Start and French-Toast</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>The sodas and picnic chairs were very nice, and we rested for a bit before looking for tent spots. It wasn't easy to     find a good tent spot around here, but we managed to find a relatively flat area in between some trees, on the other     side of the trail.</div>
