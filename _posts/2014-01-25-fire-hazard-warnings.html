<div>I was a bit worried about the snow sections of the PCT, having no real snow experience except for the recent trip     around the Mont Blanc. So I'm a little bit relieved so far, with the current snow levels so low it appears I won't     have a hard time crossing the Sierras even when starting a bit early.<br /><br />Sadly, this drought also causes severe fire warnings in California, as a recent <a href="http://www.pcta.org/2014/critical-things-2014-fire-season-16533/" target="_blank">PCTA blog post</a>    announced. It seems open fire cooking stoves will not be allowed in most places along the PCT. So there goes my plan     to use the lightweight <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-f-stove-system" target="_blank">Caldera     Keg System</a> to cook my dinners.<br /><br />The quest is on, to figure out what stove I'll buy/use on the trail.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gmJB5ypCW6g/UuNjYfuO1hI/AAAAAAADJAY/vnfI7KS1mRM/s1600/2014-01-24+08.33.34.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gmJB5ypCW6g/UuNjYfuO1hI/AAAAAAADJAY/vnfI7KS1mRM/s1600/2014-01-24+08.33.34.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">On the left - Caldera Keg-F system with spare can. On the right - MSR Whisperlite stove with fuel                     bottle, wind screen and pot.             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>I took out my old <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/simple-cooking/whisperlite/product" target="_blank">MSR Whisperlite</a> stove from the gear closet. I bought it back before I     started hiking the AT. I didn't know what I was doing with it, and filled up my fuel bottle with kerosene. For the     first 4 days on the trail, I cooked mainly in open flame burning over small kerosene puddles it created. When I got     to Neals Gap, I went through the "Gear Shakedown", and got rid of loads of stuff I sent back home. I bought an     alcohol cat stove which cooked my dinners along the trail, and I hadn't looked back on the Whisperlite since...<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9tWk8zePkGM/UuNjP99alEI/AAAAAAADJAI/CPLaruEdfFA/s1600/2014-01-24+08.35.02.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9tWk8zePkGM/UuNjP99alEI/AAAAAAADJAI/CPLaruEdfFA/s1600/2014-01-24+08.35.02.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">My complete Whisperlite kit. The pot is in a pretty bad shape.             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>Well, I did take it with me on several 2 day outings here in Israel, and learned how to use it properly with     White Gas, to cook decent meals. I can make it work.<br /><br />Today I weighed it, and it's around 322gr (11.35oz) for the stove itself, 335gr (11.81oz) for the pot and lid,     and about 585gr(20.63oz) for a 3/4 full fuel bottle. That's crazy! I want my alcohol (stove) back!<br /><br />I will probably replace the pot to some titanium &lt;1L cup. I think will be enough for my daily meals. But that's     more money on gear, and more logistics to get it to Israel.<br /><br />I started looking at MSR/Primus/Jetboil sites for their lightest stove options. Some are really expensive, and some     are not that light. MSR have the impressive but expensive <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/stove-systems/reactor-stove-systems/product" target="_blank">Reactor     Stove Systems</a> ($190). It is a bit like <a href="http://www.jetboil.com/products/comparesystems" target="_blank">JetBoil</a> ($160) - an integrated system     with a pot stand and pot. They also have the lighter and simpler <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/rapid-cooking/microrocket/product" target="_blank">MicroRocke</a>t     ($60) and <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/rapid-cooking/pocketrocket/product" target="_blank">PocketRocket</a>    ($40)     (be careful - this is also the name of a famous sex toy).<br /><br />I just got a tip to go to <a href="https://www.sierratradingpost.com/" target="_blank">Sierra Trading Post</a>,     after liking their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sierratradingpost" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>. That gets     you an extra %25 off, until Jan 28th. They are offering the <a href="http://www.sierratradingpost.com/snow-peak-litemax-titanium-stove~p~6735j/" target="_blank">Snow Peak     Litemax Titanium</a> Stove for $35, with this sale. Seems like a good deal. Shipping to Israel will double the     price, but maybe I can have it shipped to somebody in the US to keep it for me until I get there.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I have ordered the above mentioned Litemax, and also an <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/cookware/evernew-75-l-ultralight-pasta-pot-small-eca521" target="_blank">Evernew     .75 L Ultralight Pasta Pot</a> from TrailDesigns.com. They will wait for me at the Trail Angels' house in San     Diego. Can't wait to get there and open all my presents... </div>
