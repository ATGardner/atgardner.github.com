<div>I've been contemplating this whole <a href="http://pct14.blogspot.com/2014/01/trail-name-cunundrum.html" target="_blank">trail name</a> thing for a while now, trying to decide between     keeping my old name from the AT (<b>Amtrak</b>), or figuring out a new/better name for myself for this round.<br /><br />So far, on the PCT permit, and various trail registration sites (Yogi's, registering at the Mann's), I used Amtrak,     figuring out I'll just go with my default. I'm used to it. I do quite like it. It will feel like I'm back on the AT,     continuing my old adventure...<br /><br />However - a recent development in the field of optional trail names has led me to think again about adopting a new     one. I present to you, the new contender - <b>Mango</b>.<br /><br />And here are the pros, in no specific order:<br /><ul><li>I love Mango. Mostly because it is the best fruit ever. It also makes a mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassi" target="_blank">Lassi</a>.         </li><li>It's an anagram of my name (well, of "Noam G" - but I can try and go with "la Mango" as my "full trail             name").         </li><li>I can also say it derives from Man-(on-the)-Go, which is very far fetched and was completely by accident.             But it does give it some extra points.         </li></ul>So, back at square one. I suspect I won't declare a final winner until I actually land in San Diego. Maybe even only     after I finish my hike (wherever that will be).<br /><br /><u>Update:</u>    <br />Another great reason:<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LTiGC7WPacw?list=PLcwsDEfiUSgvDXIxFVxYSIWhcy6tTOR55#t=498" width="560">    </iframe></div>
