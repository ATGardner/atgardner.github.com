<div>During the night we had some rain drops, and we woke up to a cloudy day. This time the clouds remained all through
    the day.<br/>After two small climbs, we stopped just before the big decent into Middle Fork Feather River. Forty
    Five and another hiker passed us, and right behind them Young Oak and his girlfriend. She came from Paris to hike
    with him, and in two days she will finish her hike.<br/>Just after I started my decent into the river, rain drops
    started falling. I quickly removed my hiking shirt, and put on my rain jacket. It was still very hot and humid, so I
    didn't need anything under the jacket. Sadly, rain didn't come, and I got down to the river sweating in my jacket.
    It could have been worse - my jacket is rather will ventilated, when all the zippers are open.<br/>Down at the
    river, we crossed the bridge and took a side trail to get to the water. We could see a great big pool to the left of
    the bridge, from the top, but we couldn't get to it from where we were. We still found a nice shady spot, and good
    dipping holes. We both took a much needed shower in the stream, and cleaned up a bit.<br/>

    From there, we had to climb up everything we had just climbed down, and more. Luckily, there was plenty of water
    along the way, so we didn't carry too much on us.<br/>Our aim was to get to the water at wa1259, fill up there, and
    dry camp where we'd find a spot. The section right before that water source was where most of the climb was, and I
    was trying to hike it fast. It was hard. I kept hoping the water is around the corner, and it wasn't.<br/>

    The rain finally started just as I caught on to Idan. We hiked just a bit more, and found some trickle by the trail.
    We weren't sure if this is our water source or not, but we filled up some anyway. It was a really slow source, but
    it's a good thing we got water, as this was the famous wa1259.<br/>The rain wasn't too strong, but it kept on
    falling. I put on my rain jacket again, this time with good reason, and we kept on hiking just to find a good
    campsite. It took a while, since most of the trail was on a steep ridge, but eventually it got flatter, and we found
    a good spot. It is quite small, so our tents are literally touching each other.<br/>By now the rain has stopped.
    Brad, Forty Five, Salsa and another three hikers passed us. They all did more miles then we did, just to get to
    here. So it's impressive that they just keep on going.
