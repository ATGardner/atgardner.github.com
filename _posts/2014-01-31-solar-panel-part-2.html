<div>During my short trip in the Carmel recently, I tried testing my improvised solar panel to see if it can charge my     phone. It did not perform as expected. In retrospect I can say it was probably because we were mostly under trees,     and in the shade. Not the optimal conditions to test a solar charger. But when I got back home that day, I felt as     though it's not going to work between us.<br /><br />After reading many favorable reviews on the <a href="http://www.suntactics.com/product/scharger-5-emergency-kit/" target="_blank">Suntactics sCharger 5</a>, I decided to buy a kit,     along with an external 6000mA battery. The kit also comes along with a 10 LED usb powered light, which I'm going to     leave at home. I really don't see any use for it on the trail.<br /><br />The price was not so bad, with a sale price of $152.95, and a work colleague of mine was just taking of for 4 days     in Seattle, so I took the opportunity and asked him to bring it over for me, after I order it to his hotel. Luckily,     this crazy plan worked, and I am now the proud owner of the sCharger 5. Yay for me.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OJcw101eiqU/UuUDnxkN2KI/AAAAAAADJWE/rfYcZ2haaqs/s1600/2014-01-26+13.18.01.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OJcw101eiqU/UuUDnxkN2KI/AAAAAAADJWE/rfYcZ2haaqs/s1600/2014-01-26+13.18.01.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Panel with case, battery with its own little case, the LED is hiding beneath the                 instruction manuals.             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>The panel does look much better than my improvised one. Sturdy and simple, just a panel with a USB output. The     external battery also seems like a good deal, with two USB outputs (1.2mA and 2.1mA), so I guess I will be able to     charge both my phone and my camera at the same time (I just need 2 USB cables for it). This will come in handy, I     guess.<br /><br />I just need to figure out how I can secure the panel to my backpack, so it will be out and open to the sunlight     while I hike.<br /><br />As a side note - after ordering the sCharger, I took my improvised panel for another spin. This time I just put it     outside of the window, in direct sunlight, and it charged two phones easily. I guess I was too quick on the gun with     the decision to buy a charger. But the sCharger does come with the battery, which is a bonus, and it does seem     better than mine anyway. So it was not all a waste of good money... </div>
