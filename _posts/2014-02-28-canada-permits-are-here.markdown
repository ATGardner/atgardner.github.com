Just wanted to share that I got my permits to enter Canada on the PCT last night. So that's good. Still waiting for the Long Distance Hiker permits from the [PCTA]. But it's all good - I have time.

I also got two nice stickers and another PCT map (I got my first with the PCTA registration), so now I have an extra map to bring to my parents, so they can follow up on my progress easily.
