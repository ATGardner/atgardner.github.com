<div> That was a long and hard day.<br/> After getting up and getting my stuff packed at the Dinsmores, I went to the
    restaurant across the tracks with everyone else. I got the breakfast burrito, like Copper Tone recommend yesterday.
    It took a long time for the food to finally get to the table, though, and by the time we got back to the hostel it
    was already 10:00.<br/> In the mean time Mrs Dinsmore got everyone rides back to the trail. I got a ride with her,
    along with Lighthouse and Slacker. We finally reached the pass at 11:00, said our goodbyes to Copper Tone, which
    won't be waiting at the next road crossing in Rainy Pass, and Lighthouse and I headed out.<br/> The trail started
    deceptively easy, but after about a mile the climbing started. I think we have made about three big climbs today,
    each was pretty steep at times.<br/> We kept running into day hikers, and Lighthouse was too nice to them, so they
    all chatted for too long. We also ran into a trail maintenance crew that have us tiny whiskey bottles and fresh
    apples. I was talking to one of them who plans to thru hike the trail next year. Hope he manages to get it
    rolling.<br/> More ups and downs later, we figured out we will not be making the planned 24 miles, after such a late
    start. But there was a campsite about 2.5 before we can stop at.<br/> At about 17:00 we started the final 4 mile
    stretch to there, with quite a climb, and then a long downhill to the creek. The only good think were all the
    blueberries along the trail, even though they slowed us down.<br/> Right before reaching camp, Seamstress caught up
    to us. We got here together. It's s very nice, clear grassy spot, next to a flowing stream.<br/>
