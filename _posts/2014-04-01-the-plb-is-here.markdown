Yesterday I got my [Fast Find 220] device, rented from [Small-World]. It seems like a small-enough device, and I hope I will never need it.

I specifically chose a device with only an emergency option (No daily updates, or checking in along the trail), because I don't want my girlfriend to be worried if I accidentally forget to check in some day, or if it fails somehow. I will call home every chance I've got, and I believe that will be enough to keep everyone back here at ease.

Well, things are moving along. Scary stuff...
