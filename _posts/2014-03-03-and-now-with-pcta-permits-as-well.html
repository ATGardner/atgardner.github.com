<div><table align="right" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KOtWqg38nlY/UyAb-b5UQqI/AAAAAAADJ6g/BU9lzYrmFp8/s1600/2014-03-03+22.44.17.jpg" />            </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>I got back home this evening, and the <a href="http://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/permits/" target="_blank">PCTA     Long Distance Hiking Permit</a> was waiting for me in the mail. So that's it - I'm all set to go.<br /><br />I also registered on the <a href="http://adzpctko.org/reg/default.html" target="_blank">ADZPCTKO</a> site, and     posted a request for rides to and from Idyllwild. I hope that works as well.<br /><br />It also reminds me - next week we are having the Israeli Kick Off gathering. I think this is the 3rd year it's being     held. I only been to the one last year, and I really enjoyed it. Met many hikers who did the trail in 2012 and     before, and several who were heading out just after the meeting. I remember back then I was telling everyone I hope     to go out and start the trail in April 2014. I can hardly believe it's actually happening just over a month from     now. *gulp*<br /><br />Well, have a good week. I hope my planning spreadsheet is helping someone. Nobody really commented on it or asked     any specific questions. Feel free to contact me if you want to ask anything. </div>
