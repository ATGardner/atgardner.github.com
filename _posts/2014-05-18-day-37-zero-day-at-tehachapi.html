<div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Oxg6KanfU8/VYB2-guxWwI/AAAAAAAFgyI/kZYLLlhANY0/s1600/2014-05-18%2B08.26.45.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Oxg6KanfU8/VYB2-guxWwI/AAAAAAAFgyI/kZYLLlhANY0/s640/2014-05-18%2B08.26.45.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Breakfast at Kelcy's Restaurant             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>Well, for breakfast I went over to the nearby Kelcy's, which is a local establishment. I got eggs with onions,     mushrooms and tomatoes, home fries and biscuits with gravy. It was very good, but I couldn't even finish it     all.<br />Idan wanted a change of scenery, so we checked out of the Santa Fe, and headed over to the cheaper Ranch Motel.     It's a bit off the main road, but the room was much better, so it turned out well.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kc9mSx9AMzs/VYB2-3VQU8I/AAAAAAAFgyM/OkV_w8C0rjw/s1600/2014-05-18%2B18.06.39.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kc9mSx9AMzs/VYB2-3VQU8I/AAAAAAAFgyM/OkV_w8C0rjw/s640/2014-05-18%2B18.06.39.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Just a strange murial             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>Later we decided to go grocery shopping for the next section. We messaged Kay, and she picked us up in 5     minutes. That was really nice of her. We bought our food, meeting a lot of other hikers in the store. Early-B     bought some freeze dried Mountain House meals at the nearby Big 5 store, so I ditched two Knorr meals and headed     over there (with Kay driving). Sadly, they had no vegetarian meals over there, and I had to trouble Kay for     another quick stop, this time at the other supermarket, to get two Knorr meals again.<br />Back at the motel, we were just resting and doing nothing, when suddenly Idan thought of checking whether Lake     Isabella, our next stop, has somewhere to buy gas canisters. They don't. So we had to walk the long long way     back to the Big 5 (nobody stopped to give us a ride), buy the damn big can they were selling (they didn't sell     the smaller ones), and walk all the way back. Annoying and tiresome.<br />We were looking around for someplace to eat, doing a short tour in the main street. The Italian restaurant     seemed nice, but Idan was too afraid by its atmosphere. Or maybe it was the fact that Penguin was there with her     husband. Anyway, we left.<br />We passed by our old motel, and met Sock Pot, who told us that Cheese and Butters were in our old room (oh... the     memories. Feels like it was yesterday), so we     dropped by to say hello. Then we just got back to our room and ordered Domino's using their app. It wasn't easy,     but we managed to get it to work.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ym0jZN55-Bw/VYB2_dRk_vI/AAAAAAAFgyU/LxCL6AOUR_s/s1600/2014-05-18%2B21.08.56.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ym0jZN55-Bw/VYB2_dRk_vI/AAAAAAAFgyU/LxCL6AOUR_s/s640/2014-05-18%2B21.08.56.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">And Pizzas for dinner             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table></div>
