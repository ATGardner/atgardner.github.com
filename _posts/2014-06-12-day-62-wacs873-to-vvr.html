<div>Today we had a short day, finally, into Vermilion Valley Resort (VVR). We pushed a bit more in the last few days     just to make today shorter, since we wanted to get to Edison Lake early enough to catch s boat ride across it to the     resort. Otherwise we'd have had to hike 5 more miles around it.<br />We got up a bit early, again, and started our morning climb. It was about 1000 feet up. It didn't feel too bad, in     the morning.<br />From there we had about 2000 feet down to the junction to Edison Lake. I pretty much ran it without stopping, and     got     down there at 8:15. After waiting for Signal and Harmonic-Wave for a while, we all headed down towards the lake, to     the spot     where the boat should pick us up.<br />The lake is in a really bad shape, due to 3 years with not enough rain and snow. It's a pretty big lake, and it's     several meters below its full capacity. The side trail leading to the original ferry spot is not relevant anymore,     and now there's a new side trail, a bit further off, leading down to the lake's dry bed. From there it's another     half a mile or so to the actual water line.<br />On the way there I've met several hikers who just came out of VVR. Penguin and Sockpot were on their way out, with     some other hikers who passed us recently.<br />After waiting for the boat to arrive (and for Signal, Harmonic-Wave and Jordi to catch up), we all got on it, and     headed to the     other side of the lake. Once there, we got a ride from the shore, up to the resort (which is situated on the     original shore line). It was quite strange - on the ride there I could see the path boats are supposed to take when     approaching the resort, between what once were underwater rocks. Now it's all on sand.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AEhk4MF9iX8/Vfw_hp7RuQI/AAAAAAAFj70/krCi7aGQAgU/s1600/2014-06-12%25281%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AEhk4MF9iX8/Vfw_hp7RuQI/AAAAAAAFj70/krCi7aGQAgU/s640/2014-06-12%25281%2529.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Harmonic-Wave and Signal on the ferry to VVR</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>At the resort we got our first drink free, and were told we can tent behind the store. We quickly opted for a room     for the night, and got a very nice 3 bed room, with a shower. What a treat!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zY9YnSRI9LA/Vfw_flLTC_I/AAAAAAAFj7s/me8LeB4rWjY/s1600/2014-06-12.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zY9YnSRI9LA/Vfw_flLTC_I/AAAAAAAFj7s/me8LeB4rWjY/s640/2014-06-12.jpg" width="480" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">And that's me</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>After a nice shower (and after me nagging the manager about lack of hot water, and finally finding out I had to turn     the knob the other way) we went for lunch. Yair and I both had a very good black beans veggie burger. The make it     right there at the restaurant. Very impressive.<br />There are some supplies available at the store, and everything you buy, including restaurant bills, is put on your     tab. It's easy to lose a lot of money that way.<br />There is just a bit of AT&amp;T reception near the beach, so we kept leaping among the rocks to try to find a good     signal, with data maybe. I barely found anything.<br />After a good sleep at noon, we went over for dinner. Yair and I split two courses - one was polenta, rice and fried     vegetables, and the other one was pasta Alfredo with vegetables again. The vegetables were fresh, and it tasted     pretty good.<br />I stayed with Yair at the restaurant to watch a bit of the NBA finals (game four). San Antonio beat Miami. Yay.<br />That was a very nice and relaxing day.</div>
