 Another long day up ahead. 27 trail miles, along with 2+ just to get from Shelter Cove back to the trail.
 I
 got up at 6:00, packing up and going back to the store. Even though there is no cell reception here, the Wi-Fi is
 pretty good, so I did some chores, like ordering a new external battery that will wait for me in Bend, instead of
 the one from Lepow, which doesn't work well at all.
 I finally left at 8:00, and started hiking back up to the
 trail. I got there fast enough, and finally started my day.
 My first stop was at the water in Middle Rosary
 Lake, after passing the lower one. According to Halfmile's app there is no water source for the next 22 miles, but
 that's probably just some mistake. Both campsite along the way are by lakes, and even though they are not on the
 trail, they are fairly close to it.
 I hiked on and met a southbounder named Suzanna. She gave me some info
 about the closure after Olalie, and I told her about the cache near forest road 60.
 I stopped for another sorry
 break, and was later joined by Numbers, Ball Hawk and Forest. It was nice just chatting with them a bit.
 I made
 a short stop next to the next water, but didn't go down the side trail to it. I had enough on me.
 When I
 finally reached Lake Charleston, where I intended to fill up, I went in for a quick snack and some water. Sitting
 there, I saw the heavy rain clouds come in, and started hearing thunder.
 I got up with 8 more miles to go, and
 started racing with the storm. It was 16:00 when I left the lake. Shortly after, the trail started going through
 burned forest, and with the constant thunders in the site it for a bit scary. It took me another hour or so to get
 back into a living forest.
 At about 17:00, the first drops stayed to fall on me. I immediately put my camera,
 who was already in a zip lock bag, inside my waterproof backpack, and switched my hiking shirt with my reason
 jacket. But the real rain didn't come, and I kept on hiking in thunders and occasional drops.
 I met another
 southbounder, Beach Bum Buddha, about a mile before the campsite. The mosquitoes were pretty bad in this area,
 filled with small lakes. I'm sure the dampness and the rain drops didn't help.
 I finally reached the campsite
 at 18:40. There was already a couple here, tented up. The rain got a bit stronger when I got near, so I just set up
 my tent and jumped inside. After a while, during a brief dry moment, I boiled up water for dinner, then ate back in
 the tent.
 Numbers, Forest and all of Smiley's group also got here. But I'm holed up in my tent, as the rain
 drops outside.
