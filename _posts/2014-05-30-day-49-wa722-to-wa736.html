<div>Today was a bit strange.<br/>Last night was pretty cold up there. I put on everything I had, and managed to
    sleep.<br/>In the morning we left a bit late, and headed out to finish the climb from yesterday. It wasn't too long,
    and we had good views from the top on some snowy mountain tops.<br/>

    From there we had about 6 more miles of down hill, until Death Canyon Creek. We took our time on some stops, and
    also had lunch at the creek, before going to its spring source to filter some water.<br/>At the source we had to use
    a zip lock bag to get the water from the small stream, and it all took too long. In the end, we only headed out at
    14:30. Way way too late.<br/>

    We had 5.5 miles of climbing up to a spring which had no info on the water report, so we didn't know if we'll have
    water there or not. We had some plans to hike further 6 miles to a dependable water source, but this late in the
    day, it was clear we will not make it. We figured we'll hike just a bit after the first spring, and camp somewhere
    on the way.<br/>

    The climb up was long indeed, but we got some good views up to the Sierras, and down to a big valley on the other
    side. When we got to the side trail to the unknown spring, we decided to stop for the day, and just find a
    relatively sheltered spot for the night. It was already around 18:00, and the winds were strong.<br/>We found a nice
    spot. I hope it won't be too windy up here. We made camp, and cooked dinner. Happy Pants came a bit later. First
    time we've met him. He is from France. He also went further down and found the water, so we will get some tomorrow.
