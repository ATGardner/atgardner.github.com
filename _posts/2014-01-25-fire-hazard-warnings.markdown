I was a bit worried about the snow sections of the PCT, having no real snow experience except for the recent trip around the Mont Blanc. So I'm a little bit relieved so far, with the current snow levels so low it appears I won't have a hard time crossing the Sierras even when starting a bit early.

Sadly, this drought also causes severe fire warnings in California, as a recent [PCTA blog post](http://www.pcta.org/2014/critical-things-2014-fire-season-16533/) announced. It seems open fire cooking stoves will not be allowed in most places along the PCT. So there goes my plan to use the lightweight [Caldera Keg System](http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-f-stove-system) to cook my dinners.

The quest is on, to figure out what stove I'll buy/use on the trail.

I took out my old [MSR Whisperlite](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/simple-cooking/whisperlite/product) stove from the gear closet. I bought it back before I started hiking the AT. I didn't know what I was doing with it, and filled up my fuel bottle with kerosene. For the first 4 days on the trail, I cooked mainly in open flame burning over small kerosene puddles it created. When I got to Neals Gap, I went through the "Gear Shakedown", and got rid of loads of stuff I sent back home. I bought an alcohol cat stove which cooked my dinners along the trail, and I hadn't looked back on the Whisperlite since...

Well, I did take it with me on several 2 day outings here in Israel, and learned how to use it properly with White Gas, to cook decent meals. I can make it work.

Today I weighed it, and it's around 322gr (11.35oz) for the stove itself, 335gr (11.81oz) for the pot and lid, and about 585gr(20.63oz) for a 3/4 full fuel bottle. That's crazy! I want my alcohol (stove) back!

I will probably replace the pot to some titanium <1L cup. I think will be enough for my daily meals. But that's more money on gear, and more logistics to get it to Israel.

I started looking at MSR/Primus/Jetboil sites for their lightest stove options. Some are really expensive, and some are not that light. MSR have the impressive but expensive [Reactor Stove Systems](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/stove-systems/reactor-stove-systems/product) ($190). It is a bit like [JetBoil](http://www.jetboil.com/products/comparesystems) ($160) - an integrated system with a pot stand and pot. They also have the lighter and simpler [MicroRocke](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/rapid-cooking/microrocket/product)t ($60) and [PocketRocket](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/rapid-cooking/pocketrocket/product) ($40) (be careful - this is also the name of a famous sex toy).

I just got a tip to go to [Sierra Trading Post](https://www.sierratradingpost.com/), after liking their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/sierratradingpost). That gets you an extra %25 off, until Jan 28th. They are offering the [Snow Peak Litemax Titanium](http://www.sierratradingpost.com/snow-peak-litemax-titanium-stove~p~6735j/) Stove for $35, with this sale. Seems like a good deal. Shipping to Israel will double the price, but maybe I can have it shipped to somebody in the US to keep it for me until I get there.

UPDATE:
I have ordered the above mentioned Litemax, and also an [Evernew .75 L Ultralight Pasta Pot](http://www.traildesigns.com/cookware/evernew-75-l-ultralight-pasta-pot-small-eca521) from TrailDesigns.com. They will wait for me at the Trail Angels' house in San Diego. Can't wait to get there and open all my presents...
