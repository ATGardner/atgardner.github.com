OK. I've done it again. And again. (And again).

I was eyeing this very nice and lightweight wind shirt (The [Mountain     Hardwear Ghost Whisperer Anorak](http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-ghost-whisperer-anorak-OM4625.html)) at [Sierra     Trading Post](http://www.sierratradingpost.com/) for a while now, keeping it in my shopping cart. At first I was really excited about this special sale they were having, offering it with an additional %30+ discount over their usual discount rate (I think it's %25), and then I decided I don't really need it at the moment (=got vetoed over it at home), and was a bit bummed the sale was over.

Then I noticed that STP are having sales constantly, each with %25-%35 off on most items, and sometimes even more on several selected ones. So I decided to just keep an eye on the jacket, and see how it goes. Over the past 1-2 weeks I think I once saw "my" jacket for as low as $60, and I didn't buy it at the time. But it got harder and harder to just check it out every day or two, and convince myself that I can manage without it, or at most just buy it as I go along on the trail.

Finally, I decided I will actually get it and be done with it. I might regret it later, but it was on for $65, and the shipping and tax brought it up to ~$80. It's still not bad, considering its full price is $140, though currently even the Mountain Hardwear site is offering it for $107.90.

Then I started looking at the&nbsp;[Chrome Dome Trekking Umbrella](http://www.golite.com/Chrome-Dome-Trekking-Umbrella-P928.aspx). I was watching the movie ["Tell it on the Mountain"](http://tellitonthemountain.com/)&nbsp;several weeks ago with my girlfriend and several friends, and one of the things that struck us most was the heat and exposure in the desert parts of the hike. I don't mind getting wet in the rain (At least, that's what I'm telling myself at the moment), but I don't want to ruin my skin in the long term, just because I wasn't careful enough in the California Desert. I am not sure that the umbrella is neccesary, and not just an over-weight luxury item I will be carrying for no need. But I decided I'd give it a try. It is not too expensive, and at most, I can just leave it at some hiker box and carry on under my wide-brimmed hat.

Ordering the umbrella wasn't easy, though. The GoLite site does not allow using an international credit card, or PayPal/Google Checkout account, even though my shipping address was in the US anyway. I had to contact their support and ask for instructions, and was told that I can order using an international credit card by phone. It took me several days, but today I finally called them, and ordered the umbrella. The order went surprisingly smooth, except for a mistake in the email address they wrote down, but I have just fixed that by chatting with their online chat support. So that's good.

As a final purchase, I have also just ordered a set of [Halfmile](http://www.pctmap.net/) maps from [Yogi's     store](http://www.yogisbooks.com/pacific-crest-trail/halfmile-map-set-printing-services). The maps themselves are free to download from his site, which I have. The "problem" is printing all 455 pages... I was trying to print them somewhere in Israel, so I can experiment with double sided and even half size printing, but I failed to find a local print shop that can print on Letter size paper (Over here the standard is A4). I almost found one, but they weren't really answering my emails, and wouldn't give me any quote, even for a 3 page test print.

Even though Yogi is offering the full set for $30, I asked Matt Signore, who is the one dealing with the printing at Yogi's store, for a quote on half size maps (2 per side/4 per page). He offered this option for $18, but at the end I decided I'd go with the full size maps. A small test print on A4 with half size seemed almost ok, but some of the numbers were a bit too small to read, and at the end I decided that I'd rather be a bit on the safe side on this one.

So, three items. I hope this marks the end (apart from some smaller items I'll buy in the US, maybe).

I got all three items shipped to the Trail Angels' house in San Diego, so thanks again for their kind help in keeping my shipping costs to a minimum. It makes a very big difference.
