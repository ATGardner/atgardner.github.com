<div>    Wow, last night was cold! I ended up sleeping with two pairs of socks, and my hiking pants over my long johns. And     my tent's inside was all covered in frost in the morning.<br/>    For the second time on the trail, I made hot oatmeal for breakfast, and we took our time packing up. My fingers and     tires were still numb when we headed out, and only after about 20 minutes they felt good again.<br/>    After we got to the sunny side of the ridge, it was all very nice and pleasant. Most of today's trail wasn't too     hard, except for one tough climb with many switchbacks in the middle of the day. From there it was easier ridge     walking all the way into Hart's Pass.<br/>    We got here and met Rock Ocean. He is hanging around to make one final shuttle to Seattle, but chances are that     he'll leave tomorrow, so it won't help Lighthouse. We also met Pod - a triple crowner from way back, who got around     here to hike this section. They both started a fire, which helped when the cold started coming in after the sun came     down. But so far it doesn't seem as child as yesterday, so I hope tomorrow morning will be better. Especially since     we plan on waking up an hour earlier, at 5:30.<br/>    I thought about a special challenge for the last day - hiking with no knowledge of the time or checking out the     trail apps and maps. I removed all the clocks from my phone. I will just walk on the trail as long as I can, and try     not to take too many breaks until I reach the border. Lighthouse agreed to give it a shot as well.<br/>    <table class="tr-caption-container" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tbody>        <tr>            <td>                <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zINLuMTBPfk/VBmo84X_KQI/AAAAAAADUm4/ly0_km4WD_M/1410967596117.jpg">                    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zINLuMTBPfk/VBmo84X_KQI/AAAAAAADUm4/ly0_km4WD_M/1410967596117.jpg cursor: pointer;"                          width="560px"/>                </a>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td class="tr-caption">                A wide valley             </td>        </tr>        </tbody>    </table>    <table class="tr-caption-container" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tbody>        <tr>            <td>                <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OF9pK3Df_1M/VBmpAKDJSwI/AAAAAAADUnA/Rj5cv4RhfN0/1410967634703.jpg">                    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OF9pK3Df_1M/VBmpAKDJSwI/AAAAAAADUnA/Rj5cv4RhfN0/1410967634703.jpg cursor: pointer;"                          width="560px"/>                </a>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td class="tr-caption">                Definitely getting closer (eh)             </td>        </tr>        </tbody>    </table>    <table class="tr-caption-container" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tbody>        <tr>            <td>                <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8oyauRSkblg/VBmpCJTIRFI/AAAAAAADUnI/02Q8Xqlrhx4/1410967677077.jpg">                    <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8oyauRSkblg/VBmpCJTIRFI/AAAAAAADUnI/02Q8Xqlrhx4/1410967677077.jpg cursor: pointer;"                          width="560px"/>                </a>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td class="tr-caption">                The sun was setting right behind that tree             </td>        </tr>        </tbody>    </table>    <table class="tr-caption-container" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tbody>        <tr>            <td>                <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BV9oleH6jRE/VBmpEallHNI/AAAAAAADUnQ/GCaXGN6iwNw/1410967722132.jpg">                    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BV9oleH6jRE/VBmpEallHNI/AAAAAAADUnQ/GCaXGN6iwNw/1410967722132.jpg cursor: pointer;"                          width="320px"/>                </a>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td class="tr-caption">                Almost at Hart's Pass             </td>        </tr>        </tbody>    </table></div>
