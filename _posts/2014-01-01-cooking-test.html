<div>Several days ago I had a chance to try out cooking my meal "trail style", using my <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-f-stove-system" target="_blank">Caldera Keg-F Stove     System</a> and a Knorr dinner bag. I know it's not exactly like cooking on the trail, but I want to feel     confident I use the proper amount of alcohol and water, and get a satisfying meal at the end.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kYNKEn6kSzY/Ur092zhPbRI/AAAAAAADHMM/EO0YB_tVkGI/s1600/2013-12-26+19.50.24.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kYNKEn6kSzY/Ur092zhPbRI/AAAAAAADHMM/EO0YB_tVkGI/s1600/2013-12-26+19.50.24.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Caldera Keg (with a spare keg), fuel bottle, spork and lighter, and the meal I'm going to eat</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>For this test, I used just about 20ml of alcohol in the stove. I put in a bit too much water in the keg, so for the     next attempt I'll put less. Those 20ml burned for about 8 minutes, though I got a boil at around 7. So again - a bit     less fuel will also work for me.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xODsmLINjqo/Ur092iXDMNI/AAAAAAADHMI/JKzCK6k6e1w/s1600/2013-12-26+19.53.34.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xODsmLINjqo/Ur092iXDMNI/AAAAAAADHMI/JKzCK6k6e1w/s1600/2013-12-26+19.53.34.jpg" width="480" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">The stove inside the Caldera Cone</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>After the boil, I poured most of the water inside the Knorr bag (Rice with Mujadarrah), and let it sit for 10     minutes.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Tp46LYcNOY/Ur09-6T7UXI/AAAAAAADHMc/X-VtWxQuw-Y/s1600/2013-12-26+20.10.41.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Tp46LYcNOY/Ur09-6T7UXI/AAAAAAADHMc/X-VtWxQuw-Y/s1600/2013-12-26+20.10.41.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Waiting for the rice to cook, while watching "Alone in the Wild" on TV</td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>I think the 10 minute mark for cooking the rice in the bag is good. The rice was completely cooked. Maybe even a bit     less time would work, but unless I'm starving I don't think It'd matter much. After the rice is done, I poured in     about 1/2 a bag of powdered mashed potatoes, to turn it from a soupy rice meal, into a chunky potato/rice mix. It     doesn't look too tasty, but I kinda like it, and it definitely filled me up, and got me warm inside.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G0rI2aVdllo/Ur09-5qtmzI/AAAAAAADHMg/94Ruzjfez-I/s1600/2013-12-26+20.15.05.jpg" imageanchor="1">                    <img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G0rI2aVdllo/Ur09-5qtmzI/AAAAAAADHMg/94Ruzjfez-I/s1600/2013-12-26+20.15.05.jpg" width="640" />                </a>            </td>        </tr><tr>            <td class="tr-caption">Yum yum. It looks oh so inviting.             </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>I already imagine myself wolfing down one of those inside my tent, sitting under my quilt.<br /><br />Oh - and a happy new year to you all. The year of my Pacific Crest Trail Hike. </div>
