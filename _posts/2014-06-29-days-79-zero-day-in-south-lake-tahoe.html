I had a package from my wife's aunt, who lives in Florida, and was very glad to find     a chocolate krantz cake and candles, for my upcoming birthday - thank you very much, Hanna!. I lit the candles, and     other hikers sang "happy birthday" to me, before I blew them out. Everyone were very impressed by the cake, and each     new hiker that came into the store got a piece.<br />We also got a care package from Barbra, who took us a ride just after Wrightwood. It had a lot of very good home     made cookies. We also shared them with the hikers in the store, and got some with us to the room. Thanks,     Barbra.<br />We met Big Boots over there, and he got a room at a different hotel with Aqua Man and Pound Cake. We talked about     going to some buffet for lunch and/or dinner, but at the end we didn't meet up.<br />Idan and bought supplies for the next section, and for three packages we intend to send to Sierra City, Old Station     and Seiad Valley. It was a logistical nightmare, to get everything organized.<br />I got takeaway lunch from an Indian restaurant across the street. Met Rocket Llama inside, which seemed very content     by their lunch buffet, and generally by Tahoe. She took 5 zeroes in here, and will probably only leave     tomorrow.<br />We also met Medicine Man, who stayed in town for 9 days now. I don't know why.<br />For dinner, we got domino's. I managed to fumble with their app, and got a pizza with no cheese. What an idiot... I     will buy dike cheese tomorrow, and put it in the microwave...<br /><br /></div>
