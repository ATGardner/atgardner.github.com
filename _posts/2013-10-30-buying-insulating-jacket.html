<div>Back in 2002 I started my AT thru-hike really early in the season (I had to catch a David Bowie concert in February     22nd in NYC, so my thru hike arranged itself around that), and I had some really cold days and nights early on. I     did not carry a special down, or even synthetic, jacket. All I had was this simple EMS fleece outer layer. During     the colder times I just put everything on, from polartec baselayer, to hiking clothes, fleece and rain gear on top.     I was cold, but it worked.<br /><br />This time around I decided I'd like to have a simple, light-weight, insulating jacket. The highs are higher on the     PCT, and I expect to be camping in snow at least several times, so I should be prepared for it. Besides, it will     replace the heavier fleece layer.<br /><br />I checked out Outdoor Gear Lab's <a href="http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Down-Jacket-Reviews">down jacket     comparison</a>, and marked some brands to check. At first, I was really looking into the water repellent down that     was recently introduced into the market. The only company that offered such jackets was <a href="http://www.sierradesigns.com/c-34-insulated.aspx">Sierra Designs</a>, except for the <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-ghost-whisperer-down-jacket-OM5678.html?colorID=293">Ghost     Whisperer</a> by Mountain Hardwear, which seems to be an awesome jacket. But I wanted to have the hooded     option, which did not contain the treated Down. I decided I'd wait until the winter 2014 season options be     available, hoping that the treated down will appear in more options and more brands.<br /><br />About a month ago I noticed that Mountain Hardwear have finally renewed their offerings, and are not selling a <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-ghost-whisperer-hooded-down-jacket-OM5714.html?colorID=010">Hooded     Ghost Whisperer</a> with Q Shield Down (Their brand name for water repellent down). I was really looking into     buying it, trying to figure out the best way to have it shipped to Israel without paying too much. The web site did     not ship outside of the US, but <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI </a>and <a href="http://www.backcountrygear.com/">Backcountry     Gear</a> did, for about $50 more. I was also looking into a delivery company that gives you an address in the     US, and then ships the stuff to Israel itself. I used it once to buy a pair of New Balance shoes. Their rates were     $30 for the lightest package, and up. And they were also going through customs and VAT when bringing the package     over, so there's no point in hoping it will slip under the radar.<br /><br />After many evenings trying to decide which jacket I should purchase, and how should I get it over here, I finally     decided on a synthetic one. I know down is lighter and compresses better, but I figured that since I got the down     quilt, I can spare some poor geese their feathers, and manage with a heavier option after all. I did buy a rather     light <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-thermostatic-hooded-jacket-OM5667.html?colorID=372">Thermostatic     Hooded Jacket</a> from Mountain Hardwear, so I'm not complaining much. The weight difference is 306g (on my     home scales) to 212g (the Hooded Ghost Whisperer, according to their site's specs), so it's about 100g difference.     And it's also about $70 cheaper, which is another little perk.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">        <tbody><tr>            <td><img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mEBAKadc7gk/UnFK-yd6zXI/AAAAAAADBa8/bGUEyUGuS2c/s640/P1030265.JPG" width="640" />            </td>        </tr></tbody>    </table>About the shipping, I made the mistake of using the delivery company, hoping the light weight jacket will be only     $30, but at the end the bulk of the package caused it to be $50, and then I had to pay another $50 for the VAT in     Israel. So next time I'll just order directly from Backcountry Gear. Lesson learned. </div>
