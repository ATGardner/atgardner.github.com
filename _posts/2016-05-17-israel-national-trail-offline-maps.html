    Lets get it straight - I have never thru-hiked the entire Israel National Trail (INT). I started it in September
    2008, and did almost half of it
    (The northern half. The easy half), before quitting. I still hope on finishing my hike someday, either by hiking
    from Eilat to Arad (should take ~3
    weeks), or by doing the whole thing from the beginning again. <br/><br/><a

</a> <br/>The
    INT is ~1000Km long (~620 miles), and goes from the northern tip of Israel (near Kibbutz Dan), towards the Kinneret
    (Sea of Galilee), westwards to
    Mt. Carmel and the Mediterranean sea, south along the Israeli shoreline towards Tel Aviv, and then back east almost
    reaching Jerusalem (It's close
    enough to allow hopping over into the city). Further south it enters the dreaded desert section, which contains long
    and hard stretches without any
    natural water sources, crosses many beautiful areas like the Small, Big and Ramon Craters, and finally reaches the
    southern most city in Israel -
    Eilat, by the Red Sea. <br/><br/>A great source of information about the INT can be found in its Wiki page. There's
    a <a el="INT"
         href="http://shvil.wikia.com/wiki/INT_Trail_Angels"
         onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">Trail
    Angels list</a>, a list of <a el="INT" href="http://shvil.wikia.com/wiki/Services_on_the_INT"
                                  onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">Services along the
    trail</a>, and a list of <a el="INT"
                                href="http://shvil.wikia.com/wiki/Water_in_the_Negev"
                                onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">Water
    Sources in the Desert</a>, all in English. There is also a lot of up-to-date information at the <a el="INT"
                                                                                                       href="http://israeltrail.myfastforum.org/"
                                                                                                       onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">Israel
    National Trail Forum</a>, including a discount to a good guide book in English.<br/><br/>Unlike long trails in the
    US, there are no fixed water
    caches in the desert part of the trail, so be sure to understand that the "Water Cache" entries in the Water Sources
    list are only popular
    suggestions for places that people normally use for their own water caches. They do not contain any publicly
    available water, and caching water
    there would take time and/or money. It is possible to hike the trail without any caches, but it will require some
    detours to nearby settlements, and
    some 2-day water carries. Please do not go into the desert section without considering the options, and knowing what
    you are going into.<br/><br/>I
    have created an offline map file along the trail, using data from <a el="INT" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/"
                                                                         onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">OpenStreetMaps</a>

    Map</a>. I changed the rendering
    rules to use the English place name labels (where available), so that the map will be more useful for hikers from
    abroad. <br/>
    <div id="map-int"></div>
    <br/>This map sample displays Hebrew labels, and is here to show you the quality of the map before downloading.
    There is an English version of that
    map available to download at the end of this post.<br/><br/>You can get an updated gpx file of the entire trail
    using <a el="INT"

             onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">this</a>
    link. This uses a <a el="INT" href="https://github.com/ATGardner/OSMExport"
                         onclick="return trackOutboundLink.apply(this, arguments);">simple
    app</a> I wrote that exports an OSM relation to a gpx file directly from their servers. That link uses relationId
    282071, which is the Id of the
    INT, but you can substitute it with any other relationId you might be interested in, if you want to download an
    updated gpx of some other
    trail.<br/>
    <h3> Disclaimer</h3>All the data was used "as-is", and I do not take responsibility for its correctness. Please use
    your judgment when navigating
    along the trail (or anywhere else). Any errors or omissions I made in the process of compiling the files are my own.<br/>
