<div>The plan was to do a longer day, of about 19 miles, but we had a hard time hitching on the freeway ramp. We moved
    to the main street, near the McDonald's (and I got a vanilla shake) and it didn't work much better, until a pickup
    stopped, and the driver said he'd be right back and take us up to Walker Pass.<br/>It turns out he is the guy taking
    down the trash from Yogi's cook out up at the campground, and he also just dropped some other hikers at the motel.
    Anyway, he got us back up just before noon. A late start on a hot and hard day.<br/><br/>

    We hung around the campground for a while, got cheese toasts for lunch, and drank some cool soda, but finally we
    headed out at 14:00, aiming at the spring about 13 miles down the trail.<br/>The hike started with a long long
    climb. We stopped for some munching at the first campsite, 4.5 miles in. But it just kept on climbing afterwards. We
    did manage to make our second short stop at the top of the climb, so since then it was all downhill for the rest of
    the day.<br/>

    We got to the spring just before 19:00, and headed down the steep side trail to the water. Down by the trough there
    was a weekend hiker setting up camp, and another guy we just met at the cook out, taking a sort of a hiker bath,
    with a bandana. We just filled out our water, treated the for the first time with Aqua Mira (because Idan is worried
    that in this section filtering isn't enough), and headed back a short way towards the trail, where we saw a nice
    spot for our tents.<br/>

    A quick dinner, and we are going to sleep late now, at 20:30. Tomorrow a long and hard day.
