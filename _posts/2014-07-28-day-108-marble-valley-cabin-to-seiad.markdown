 We got up early to hike the long miles to Seiad Valley and get there before the store closes.
 We thought we'd
 have a 30 miles day, but after checking again we were surprised to discover it'll be 32 miles almost. With a 6 mile
 road walk at the end. At least it will be an easy walk.
 We made snack stops every several miles, leap frogging
 with Rim Shot and Kit for a while. They were planning to stop at the campground before the road walk.
 After
 some climbs at the beginning of the day, the rest of the hike was downhill. We stopped at a very nice creek with
 cold water, and met a father and soon section hiking. The father was 70 years old. It was very impressive seeing
 them hike.
 From there, we started hiking down Gridler creek. The trail crossed it four times, on wooden
 bridges, until it reaches the campground at the end. We thought this section will be a bit harder, but it turned out
 quite nice and easy, and we made good time, reaching the campground at 17:00.
 We still had 6 more miles of
 boring road walk, but at least we saw a sign that informed us the store would be open until 20:00. So we'll make it.

 The road walk was uneventful, and finally we reached Seiad Valley RV park at around 19:30. We started by drinking
 some cold ice tea (Idan had two cans), and then went to the RV park office and paid for camping, showers and
 laundry.
 There are a ton of new hikers around, and we don't know almost anyone. We have finally caught up to
 Halfmile, though, and unlike the previous two times, we are not just taking a zero and getting behind him
 again!
 We also met Frank, which we last saw the day we got to Paradise Valley Cafe, just before Idlewild.
 That's a long long time ago.
 The showers were the worst on the trail. Maybe similar to the ones at Kennedy
 Meadows. But the water were hot, and there was soap and shampoo. So it worked.
 At the store, I felt hungry and
 bought a can of refried beans. I looked to see it doesn't contain any meat products inside. I wanted to share the
 can with Idan, after we easy our normal Knorr meals. After we cooked, and I opened the can, I checked again the
 ingredients - it contained lard, and I missed it before. We just threw it in the garbage. I was too full
 anyway...
 Most hikers are cowboy camping on the lawn here, but we tent, as always. There are plenty of
 mosquitoes around. Besides, we don't plan on leaving too early tomorrow, so we can take our time in the morning to
 take the tents down.
