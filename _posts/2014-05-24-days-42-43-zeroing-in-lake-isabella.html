<div>After the great trail magic dinner up at Walker Pass campground, we also had pancake breakfast for dinner. I failed     miserably, and only had one. What can I say? I'm not a breakfast person.<br />There was another hiker that came in last night, after doing a 40 mile day. And two more that strolled in this     morning after doing over 30 yesterday. They were all heading out, and not going into town.<br />We went out to the highway, and got a hitch in about 10 minutes. The lady who picked us up, Helen, said she just     started noticing hikers on this road this year. She leaves in Ridgecrest, and drives over to Lake Isabella every     Friday. Two weeks ago she picked up a thru-Hiker from Scotland, and first learned on the whole pct. She was very     interested in our hike, and asked a lot of questions about it.<br />When we got down to Lake Isabella, she said she'd like to take us over to the next town of Kernville, to show us the     nice Park over there. So she drove 10 extra miles over there, and we saw the nice Park and the Kern river over     there.<br />Afterwards she got us back to the Lake Isabella motel, and we waited for Big Boots, Rudolph and Bambi. We all shared     a two queen size bed room, and Big Boots got to sleep on the floor (and pay less).<br />We did our laundry while waiting for the room to be ready, and later had a shower. It feels so much nicer to be     clean in towns.<br />Idan and I went over to eat something for lunch. I had a burrito. It was all right, but wasn't made of the freshest     ingredients. Then we went to Vons and got supplies for the next, 2.5 days, section to Kennedy Meadows. We also got     some town food for tomorrow breakfast and lunch.<br />Many other hikers arrived during the day, filling up the motel. At the evening Writer came in with a new shipment of     hikers, including Penguin. Writer has started a thru-hike on April, and wanted to write about the trail and the     hikers. She switched to section hiking, to concentrate more on her writing. She posts her articles on <a href="http://howdoyouhikethepct.com/">http://howdoyouhikethepct.com</a><br />I went for dinner with Big Boots, Sock Pot, Young Oak and Writer, at a nearby Mexican place (a real restaurant, not     the fast food from lunch). Writer kept asking us about what motivates us, and what makes us hike the trail. It was     an interesting conversation. She got our contact details so she will be able to ask more questions later, for her     project.<br />On our second zero we pretty much did nothing except move three rooms down. And a sand twister took Idan's hat     flying across the road, when we went out for lunch.</div>
